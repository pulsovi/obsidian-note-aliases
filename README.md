# Note aliases

This plugin allows fine management of note aliases in Obsidian.

Several features are planned. Only one is available at the moment, but it is essential.

## Commands

|--|----|-----------|
|save-alias|Save alias of the link under cursor in the target note frontmatter|When the cursor is positioned on a wikilink with an alias, this function finds or creates the target note of this link and adds this alias to the list of aliases registered in the YAML frontmatter of this note|
